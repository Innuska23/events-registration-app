## Description:

Events Registration App

## Overview

Web-based application for events registration.
There are three complexity levels: base, middle and advanced.
The base level is sufficient to pass the test task stage. Still, accomplished tasks with a harder
level of complexity will highly increase your chance of getting to the school.

## Requirements

- Add instructions in the readme.md file on how to run the application.
- Upload source code to GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab and share a link.
- Host an application in any preferable way and share the URL to access it.
- The front-end part must be done in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with or without any
  framework), with any preferred design style.
- The back-end part can be done in NodeJS with or without any framework.
- Use any relational or non-relational database.
